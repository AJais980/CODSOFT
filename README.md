# Codsoft Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship at [Codsoft](https://codsoft.in). I had the opportunity to work on two different projects during my internship, one in Java Programming and another in Web Development.

## Java Programming Internship

### Number Game
- Description: In this project, I created a number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 to 100, and the user has to guess it. The number of attempts is limited, and the user receives feedback based on their guesses and the actual number. Users can restart the game if they wish.
- File: [NumberGame.java](Java%20Programming/NumberGame.java)

### Student Grade Calculator
- Description: This project involved creating a student grade calculator. It takes input marks for different subjects from the user, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the percentage obtained.
- File: [StudentGradeCalculator.java](Java%20Programming/StudentGradeCalculator.java)

### ATM Interface
- Description: I designed a user interface for an ATM, including options for withdraw, deposit, and checking the balance. The project involved two classes, one for the ATM and another for the bank account, connected through inheritance.
